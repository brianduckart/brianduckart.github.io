Hello,

I'm Brian and I enjoy working on web design, front-end development and photography. I care a lot about well designed UX and I do a lot of testing to make sure my projects work properly on a variety of devices. I'll be adding to my portfolio on GitHub and hope to use it for other projects as well. When I'm not working I enjoy pour-over coffee, cooking, local craft beer, walking by the ocean and photography.

Thanks for reading this!
Brian
